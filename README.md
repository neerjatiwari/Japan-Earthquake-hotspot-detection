# Japan-Earthquake-hotspot-detection

I hereby declare that the work that is being presented by me in this project/study entitled “Japan 
Earthquake Hotspot Detection Using K-Means Clustering Method” is an authentic record of my 
own analysis and theoretical research carried out during the period from 1
st July 2022 to 31st
August 2022 under the supervision of Mr. Anand Prakash, Scientist ‘D’. (Institute of Systems Studies 
and Analyses, Defence R&D Organisation, Ministry of Defence, Metcalfe House, Delhi 110054).

The aim of this study is to apply algorithm like K-mean Clustering algorithm on Japan Earthquake 
(2001-2018) Dataset to detect Hotspot which is in the field of 'Clustering' which is related to data mining, machine learning and lies under AI techniques.

Working of K-Means clustering Algorithm
The following stages will help us understand how the K-Means clustering technique works-
• Step 1: First, we need to provide the number of clusters, K, that need to be generated 
by this algorithm.
• Step 2: Next, choose K data points at random and assign each to a cluster. Briefly, 
categorize the data based on the number of data points.
• Step 3: The cluster centroids will now be computed.
• Step 4: Iterate the steps below until we find the ideal centroid, which is the assigning 
of data points to clusters that do not vary.
• 4.1 The sum of squared distances between data points and centroids would be 
calculated first.
• 4.2 At this point, we need to allocate each data point to the cluster that is closest to 
the others (centroid).
• 4.3 Finally, compute the centroids for the clusters by averaging all of the cluster’s data 
points.
K-means implements the Expectation-Maximization strategy to solve the problem. The 
Expectation-step is used to assign data points to the nearest cluster, and the Maximizationstep is used to compute the centroid of each cluster.
